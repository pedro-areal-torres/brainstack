# Engineering Notes

This repository is my personal space to review, write down, and go deeper into topics I want to better understand or revisit.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

- **algorithms**: Practical exercises and explanations focused on data structures, problem solving, and time/space complexity (Big O).
- **system-design**: Notes and visuals to understand how systems fit together, aiming to think like a software engineer, not just a developer.
